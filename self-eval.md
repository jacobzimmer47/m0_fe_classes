# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
I felt good about this cfu
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
I did not do great about taking breaks today, but this week i did fine.
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
I need to spend the next weeks refreshing on the basics. I need to take regular breaks and make sure to eat.
